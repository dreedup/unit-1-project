This is the game of TIC TAC TOE

PLAYER 1 IS ALWAYS X
PLAYER 2 IS ALWAYS O

You begin the game by choosing and clicking a tile
Once a tile is clicked your Player symbol is placed in the tile.
Then the Player's turn switches.

RULES:

- The goal of the game is to recieve 3 in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally by placing your PLAYER SYMBOL in a tile.

Once a player has achieved this then he will be titled as the Winner of that ROUND.
From here the Player would reset the game by pressing the NEW ROUND button and it will collect the Players wins as well as reset the game entirely.

Once a player has collected 3 wins he will be titled CHAMPION and the game is over.
